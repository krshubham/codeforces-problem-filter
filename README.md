# codeforces-problem-filter

I always wanted to practice questions from codeforces in a way like:

> Get 5 problems having tag dp and all should be problem A

Thus this script for now fetches all the problems for you of a particular tag and index and stores them as pdf in the problems directory which is created in the repo automatically.

The supported values, for now, are:

**tags**: Whatever tags you see on the codeforces problems like dp, math, sortings etc.
**limit**: You can specify the number of problems you want. Put 0 for getting all problems.
